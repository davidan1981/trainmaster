Dear <%= @user.username %>,

You have requested to reset your password. Here are the user UUID and reset
token. Make a PATCH request on the UUID with the reset token to set a new
password. For instance, 

http PATCH /users/current token=...  password=reallysecret password_confirmation=reallysecret

will set the password to "reallysecret" (without quotes) for the user to
whom the reset token was issued.

Here is the reset token: @user.reset_token

Good luck! :)
