<p>Dear <%= @user.username %>,</p>

<p>You have requested to reset your password. Here are the user UUID and
reset token. Make a PATCH request on the UUID with the reset token to set a
new password. For instance, <pre>http PATCH /users/current token=<%=
@user.reset_token %> password=reallysecret
password_confirmation=reallysecret</pre> will set the password to
<pre>reallysecret</pre> for the user to whom the reset token was issued.
Here is the reset token:</p>

<pre><%= @user.reset_token %></pre>

<p>Good luck! :)</p>
